# 🛡️ S.I.F.E.R
**Surveillance Interface For Enhanced Response**

S.I.F.E.R is an advanced monitoring system that connects Android and PC devices into a unified security network.  
It collects security and analytical logs and sends them to a central control hub (Mini PC) for real-time analysis and alerts.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Collect sensitive security data (location, app permissions, network state).  
- Send logs to a central server for analysis and threat classification.  
- Trigger audio alerts when threats exceed a defined risk level.  
- Store and analyze behavioral data over time.  

---

## 🧩 System Components

### Android Client
- Periodic location tracking.  
- Monitoring changes in app permissions.  
- Monitoring network connectivity and internet state.  
- Local log storage during connection loss.  
- Real-time log transmission via WebSocket to the Mini PC.  

### Mini PC Server
- Receive logs from connected devices.  
- Analyze and classify events (Low, Medium, High, Critical).  
- Provide a live Dashboard for monitoring events.  
- Trigger audio alerts on critical threats.

## 🔐 Security Features
- Works without root access.  
- Secure temporary storage during network outages.  
- Encrypted communication via WebSocket Secure (wss://).  
- Runs silently in the background.
